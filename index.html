	<h1> Welcome</h1>
	<p>My name is Ezenwaka Ifeanyi. I am a <br>Writer and a poet with some online recognition in the Poetry World. I am a Front-end developer and an avid reader. I don't dwell within the purview of my field as you can see me in other fields perusing and absorbing knowledge like a sponge. I will be sharing two of my poems on this page for your pleasure. Recline and enjoy the wave of words on your screen

	<h1> Road to Fate </h1>
	<p>
		Hopes are dashed to smithereens<br> The blind men are on a futile chase<br> Pittance are given to workers<br> Yet they carve a smile on their face.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wishes of a country stepped upon by wicked apes <br> Grins and laughter fills the room of their sacred safes <br> Bowing Irokos laughing at Human greed <br> Soils are waiting to end our mischief.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now the sun is bright and the Apes are gone<br>Safes are stolen by the one who knows all <br> With a feathered ink I write an ode creed <br> Creed to be sung for our leaders in the seat of mischief.

	<h1>Witches Tale</h1>
	<p> Call me a sea gull, for many galls have i eaten.<br> When they lie in the night, i ring a bell for our meeting. <br> Worthless humans, worthless souls <br> What i cherish most is their blood in a bowl</p>
	<p>They cast and bind, yet they fall into my trap<br> I send my girls to them, and they try to see in-between their laps<br> Have you not heard of my prowess from your ancestors foot?<br> I am a fortress , I destroy you from your root </p>
	<p> Oh! How we miss those fresh sacrifices<br> Your ancestors were wiser, they paid their taxes<br> Who shall save you from our clutches<br>Weak humans hardly believing their doctrines.
